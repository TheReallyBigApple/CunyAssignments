# Overview
***


<br><br>

Amazon Music Unlimited is a service that charges a monthly fee of 10 dollars ( or 8 for Prime members ).
<br>
Its home page consists of a main banner entitled *My Likes and More* and underneath that, 4 ribbons 
consisting of 7 ablums, which the user can scroll left and right to see more.

# Recommendations
***
<br>

The recommender system needs to decide on what banner to show, what themes for the ribbons, 
and then what albums specifically to offer inside the ribbons.

<br>

Note, the user can scroll down to see even more banners and ribbons, including 
"New Releases For You", "Albums for You", "Ultra HD Albums" and many others.

# Scenario Design
***

<br><br>

**Who are your target users ?**
<br>
&emsp;&emsp; Music lovers. Specifically those who would want to purchase a music service and never cancel. 
	

**What are their key gaols ?**
<br>
&emsp;&emsp; To explore. There is a certain buzz to exploring music.
	They also want to discover new music that they love.

**How can you help them accomplish their goals?**
<br>
&emsp;&emsp; The web site should be fun. It should help the music lover find that buzz.

# Reverse Engineering
***

<br><br><br><br>



I think Amazon has a nigthly offline-generated list of albums with a calculated, numerical factor for each category.
<br><br>
For example, "You might like" and "Albums for You", based on similar customers (collaborative) , 
		and similar music choices (search-based methods) would produce a list of 500 recommended albums,
		order by the most recommended to least recommended.
<br><br>
	The degree of recommended is represented by a calculation using many factors including ...
<br><br>



<ol>
		<li>User history of clicking on new recommendations</li>
		<li>User history of clicking on old recommendations</li>
		<li>User history of playing music in entirety</li>
		<li>User history of playing music partially</li>
		<li>Similar User history of clicking on recommendations</li>
		<li>Similar User history of playing music in entirety</li>
		<li>Similar user history of playing music partially</li>
		<li>User history of Variety across disparate genres</li>
		<li>User history of Variety across musical eras</li>
</ol>


<br><br>
	The algorithm would return factors that yield a probability matrix
	to determine the likelhood of ...
<br><br>

<ol>
		<li>Changing the recommended albums (how often)</li>
    <li>Changing the ribbon titles (how often)</li>
    <li>The genres of the recommendations</li>
    <li>The specific albums</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
Its important to point out. The recommendations dont need to change every day.
The consumer may stare at a recommendation for a week and get *convinced* to
click on it and enjoy it.
<br><br>

Lastly, the randomizer will select 8 albums from the large list, using a probability function that
		uses the factors to randomly select the recommendations.

# Suggestions
***

I would suggest gap analysis, for example to gratify a consumer with a history of listenging to 70s, 80s and current,
offer the 90s and 00s under the same genres.

I would also suggest focused surveys with target consumers to help validate your interpretation of the results.
